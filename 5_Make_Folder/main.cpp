/*
Given class Triangle (in files Triangle.h and Triangle.cpp), complete main() to read and set the base and height of triangle1 and of triangle2, determine which triangle's area is smaller, and output that triangle's info, making use of Triangle's relevant member functions.

Ex: If the input is:

3.0 4.0
4.0 5.0
where 3.0 is triangle1's base, 4.0 is triangle1's height, 4.0 is triangle2's base, and 5.0 is triangle2's height, the output is:

Triangle with smaller area:
Base: 3.00
Height: 4.00
Area: 6.00
