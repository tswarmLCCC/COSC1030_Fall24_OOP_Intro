You will need to compile and link these files using the console.

To compile the two cpp files in your assiggnment, you can do this:

g++ -c Triangle.cpp main.cpp

or

c++ -c Triangle.cpp main.cpp if using Replit

You should see Triangle.o and main.o

You'll also need to link these like this:

g++ -o Triangle.o main.o

and finally run main:

./main.exe 

The other PRIMM examples will be similar, just with different names.
